S4 (Simple Scalable Streaming System): an open source streaming computing platform, which is universal, distributed, scalable, partitioned, fault-tolerant, pluggable streaming system.

As for the functions of themia theme, kaedea has introduced in detail in his personal blog HEXO Responsive Theme・ THEMIA.The reason for choosing this theme is that it has a rich image processing ability and a simple and understandable structure which facilitates the personalized modification on it. ~~。Besides, the special processing on mobile phone is another major feature of this theme, despite the fact that I do not focus on the optimization of mobile phone. Compared with themia，what is the different feature of the messy Sooyalo?The reason why it’s called messy is that most of the parts I add are widgets, and the original structure hasn’t changed much. And as far as I’m concerned, probably no one would choose to use this theme directly (this blog is written for fun anyway), so it might be more appropriate to write all the code of these components directly.

So it’s better to start your own business. According to official documents, directly referring to TOC functions can automatically generate a list of articles. You can choose to create a toc.ejs component separately.12345&lt;% if (post.toc != false) &#123; %&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;toc&quot;&gt; &lt;%- toc(post.content, &#123;list_number: false&#125;) %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; Then the corresponding CSS layout is carried out:12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849#toc &#123; position: fixed; right: 0%; width: 320px; height: 90%; top: 15px;&#125;for i in (1..6) &#123; .toc-level-&#123;i&#125; .toc-text &#123;margin-left: i em;&#125;&#125;.toc-text &#123;white-space: nowrap;&#125;.toc-link &#123; color: #999; display: inline-block; // stretch to parent height border-left: 1px solid transparent; // avoid &quot;jumping&quot; on hover &amp;:hover &#123;text-decoration: none;&#125;&#125;.toc &#123; padding: 0; margin: 0; line-height: 1.8em; overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#125;.toc-child &#123; margin-left: 0; padding-left: 0;&#125;.toc-item &#123; list-style-type: none; &amp;:hover &gt; .toc-link &#123;border-left: 1px solid $color-theme;&#125; &amp;.active &#123; &gt; .toc-link &#123; color: $color-theme; border-left: 2px solid $color-theme; &#125; if(hexo-config(&apos;toc.collapse&apos;)) &#123; .toc-child &#123;display: block;&#125; &#125; &#125;&#125;.toc-item.active .toc-child &#123; display: block; &#125; At last, do this:1&lt;%- partial() %&gt; The function is to place toc.ejs in the Right place, which means it must be chosen correctly, otherwise there will probably be a logical bug. After that, a superb TOC component is completed.Later on I may further improve this part, such as adding animation effects, or making it move with the picture. But well, I’ve been busy lately. Back to Top Button with percentage styleThe circle in the lower left corner moves with the number of pages changing, which can lead you to the top if you click it, is mainly referring to the use of [unnamed42] (https://unnamed42.github.io/2016-09-10-Hexo%E6%8A%98%E8%85%BE%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0.html%E7%99%BE%E5%88%AF%E6%E6%E6%B7%E6%E6%E6%E6%E8%E8%EBC). Also, some logical and positional adjustments have been made to my blog, first is the EJS file and then the CSS file.

How to make trade-offs is also personal. To take my own website as an example, it may run a bit slow when using some kind of mobile phones, but PC is generally no problem. Statistics of Bu Suan zi (不蒜子是啥，卜算子？音译了)flowJust as what the official website says, only two lines of code are used, one is to introduce JS script, the other is to use it.1234&lt;script async src=&quot;//dn-lbstatics.qbox.me/busuanzi/2.3/busuanzi.pure.mini.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;busuanzi_container_site_pv&quot;&gt;Total site visits &lt;spanid=&quot;busuanzi_value_site_pv&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;次&lt;/span&gt; Provide free statistics services for static web sites. great~ css Layout AdjudgementThe main purpose is to make room for those small layouts. In addition, some layouts (background A, log width, etc.) should be personalized. These are some trivial basic operations of CSS in F12 and it’s not necessary to write them out in detail. They can be adjusted according to personal preferences. OthersIn fact, there are still many details to be modified, like the deletion of redundant files, the adjustment of layout, etc… Something elseThe blog approximately costs me over two or three weeks and it can now be used! At first, the estimated time is just a week to do it casually. But later on, more adjustments were needed, plus I am not expert in front-end, and still have other courses to learn, so I didn’t mean to do it really seriously. But now I really love the thing I created and if I have more time afterwards, I’ll further optimize the blog, like focusing on the big end of the mobile phone and adding some widgets. After all, I hate minimalism XD.","categories":[{"name":"Web front end performance","slug":"Web-front-end-performance","permalink":"http://www.yansera.com/categories/Web-front-end-performance/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://www.yansera.com/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Sooyaro","slug":"Sooyaro","permalink":"http://www.yansera.com/tags/Sooyaro/"}]},{"title":"Today My Blog is Officially Started!~","slug":"Today My Blog is Officially Started!","date":"2018-06-24T14:51:50.000Z","updated":"2018-11-15T06:32:09.667Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/06/24/Today My Blog is Officially Started!/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yansera.com/2018/06/24/Today My Blog is Officially Started!/","excerpt":"It took me two or three weeks to set up this blog.
